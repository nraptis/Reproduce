    "The model demonstrates strong segmentation performance for cells with relatively round and well-defined morphology. Nuclear regions, in particular, are segmented with high consistency and sharp boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, segmentation quality degrades for more irregular or amoeboid cell shapes. In these cases, the model often produces incomplete or fragmented cytoplasmic regions. A recurring failure pattern involves carving gaps through the cytoplasm, suggesting difficulty maintaining contiguous segmentation in areas with low contrast or complex morphology.\n",
    "\n",
    "These behaviors indicate that the model is more robust at capturing nuclear features than cytoplasmic structure, likely influenced by both dataset composition and architectural bias toward high-contrast boundaries."

    "This notebook provides a valuable reference for understanding the practical strengths and limitations of UNet-based segmentation in hematologic imaging. While the approach is effective for well-defined cells, its sensitivity to irregular morphology highlights challenges that must be addressed in clinically realistic pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Capstone project, these findings reinforce the importance of integrating segmentation models that are resilient to morphological variability and capable of handling complex cellular contexts. The exercise also underscores the necessity of combining qualitative and quantitative evaluation when assessing segmentation models intended for downstream diagnostic use."

At the same time, its limitations on irregular cell shapes provide meaningful guidance for future architectural and dataset design choices in the Capstone project."
