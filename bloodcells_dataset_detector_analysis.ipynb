This level of visual uniformity is unlikely to reflect real clinical peripheral blood smears, which often contain overlapping cells, staining artifacts, platelet interference, and variable field composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of Explicit Preprocessing\n",
    "The pipeline does not include explicit preprocessing steps such as stain normalization, artifact handling, deduplication, or stratified balancing. The absence of these steps suggests that the dataset has already been preprocessed implicitly through selection and curation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clinical Generalizability\n",
    "While accuracy metrics are strong, the experimental setup does not evaluate robustness under realistic distribution shifts, such as class imbalance, mixed-cell fields, or ambiguous morphology. As a result, performance is likely to degrade when applied directly to real clinical data."

    "\n",
    "This notebook reproduces a convolutional neural network–based blood cell classification task using a publicly available Kaggle dataset composed of eight morphologically distinct blood cell classes. The approach reflects a common strategy in the literature: training standard CNN architectures on curated microscopic cell images to achieve high classification accuracy. While effective as a benchmark, this setup highlights a key limitation addressed in the Capstone project, namely that strong performance on curated datasets does not necessarily translate to robustness under clinically realistic conditions such as mixed-cell fields, platelet interference, or staining variability."
