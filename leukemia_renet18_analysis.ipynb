    "The leukemia_resnet18.ipynb notebook demonstrates a technically sound deep learning pipeline and was successfully reproduced under non-CUDA hardware constraints. However, its use of fold labels as classification targets limits its diagnostic relevance. The insights gained from this reproduction reinforce the importance of aligning dataset design, labels, and evaluation metrics with the intended clinical task—a core principle guiding the Capstone project."
