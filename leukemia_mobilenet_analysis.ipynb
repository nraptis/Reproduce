    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a strong example of how modern lightweight architectures, such as MobileNetV2, can achieve high performance on leukemia classification when trained on curated nuclei datasets. It demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning and carefully designed classifier heads for binary medical imaging tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it also underscores a central motivation of the Capstone project: high accuracy on curated nuclei does not equate to robust clinical applicability. The Capstone explicitly targets end-to-end realism by incorporating raw smear context, platelet-aware categorization, and broader lineage coverage, rather than relying solely on masked nuclei and narrowly defined disease labels."

    "Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The leukemia_mobilenet.ipynb notebook was successfully reproduced on macOS after resolving CUDA-specific implementation constraints. The model achieved strong classification performance despite reduced training time. Nevertheless, its reliance on pre-segmented nuclei and its focus on a single leukemia subtype limit its clinical generalizability. The insights gained from this reproduction reinforce the importance of dataset realism and task definition, both of which are central to the Capstone project’s design philosophy."
