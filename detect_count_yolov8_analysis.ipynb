    "\n",
    "However, several limitations were observed:\n",
    "    * Bounding boxes occasionally extend beyond true cell borders or are overly conservative, cutting into the cell interior.\n",
    "    * Performance degrades noticeably in regions with overlapping or tightly clustered cells, where bounding boxes may merge, misalign, or miss cells entirely.\n",
    "    * The model performs best on images with clearly separated cells and minimal spatial crowding.\n",
    "\n",
    "These behaviors are consistent with other YOLO-based demonstrations in domains such as traffic detection and wildlife monitoring, where overlapping objects present similar challenges."

    "Limitations and Clinical Considerations\n",

    "Despite strong qualitative performance, this approach is not sufficient for direct clinical deployment. The model lacks the robustness required to reliably handle dense, heterogeneous cellular environments typical of real peripheral blood smears.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, the detector shows promise as a high-throughput proposal generator. In particular, it may be effective for automatically extracting large numbers of candidate WBC crops from peripheral blood images, which could then be passed to more specialized single-cell classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "At present, the project does not include a finalized pipeline for cell cropping and downstream classification. This reflects a broader limitation of available public datasets: large, well-labeled multi-cell images are scarce, while most high-quality datasets focus on isolated single-cell imagery."

Such an approach could leverage the strengths of curated single-cell datasets while partially addressing the lack of large-scale annotated smear-level data."

    "The detect_count_yolov8.ipynb notebook successfully reproduces a YOLOv8-based blood cell detection pipeline using the BCCD dataset. The model performs well on isolated cells and produces results comparable to other YOLOv8 demonstrations. However, limitations in handling overlapping cells and dense morphology restrict its clinical applicability. The insights gained from this reproduction inform the Capstone’s focus on realism, data availability, and the careful integration of detection and classification stages."
